1. How To Build A Robot

Enter the component editor.
In the bottom bar you will see all
the components you have, click in 
any of those and hover over the 3d 
object in the middle of the screen,
you should now see the selected 
component with a purple tint over
the object you are hovering, if 
not, make sure you are in placement
mode(󰐕).

You can use other tools on the 
side to remove, rotate, translate or
rename the components,
once you are done click done... yes
 

2. How To Get Components

To build a robot you need components,
you can get components by dismantling
robots or picking them from the
ground and bringing them to the 
basement.

# How To Dismantle A Robot

Once you brought a stranded robot to
your basement, enter the component 
editor and click the remove tool(󰩺).
that's it, when you remove a
component, you are adding it to your
inventory.


3. Why Are My Components Red?

Your components are red because they
are overlapping each other. You can
fix this by removing or translating
any of the involved components until
there are no more overlaps.


4. Why Are My Components Blue?

Your components are blue because 
they have too much space between. 
To fix it try placing a components
to bridge them or by bringing them
closer, removing works too.


5. Why Can't I Place Components?

Make sure you have components in
your inventory, look at the bottom
of the screen, if you see no bar,
you don't have any components 
(also read "2. How To Get 
Components"), if otherwise, click
in any component on the inventory,
in the case that the preview of 
your component is red, check that
there are no other components in
the way.
